SAKUA2: How it works.

User Visits website, lets say a banking website.

Website requests login info:
User enters: loginname


Website prompts:
DOB XX/07/19YY
Twitter : xxxxreal
Phone : 956vvZZ977
Random (saved by you): 1234123ffff891234 


Please enter:
XXxxYYvvZZffff
(This would generate the seed pin that is used to generate the seed string, Domino Password Algo can be used for this as well)



Website prompts:
Enter The Pin
Enter the domino password

(Domino password is then once again used to generate the final encryption key).



The user is then authenticated and validated.
